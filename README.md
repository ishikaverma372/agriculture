The main purpose of this project was to im- plement and demonstrate the use of the software  for deafblind people in order to convert video to braille printed scripts. It is found that it is best suitable for implementing a system for a visually handicapped person with an efficient way of video to Braille conversion with flexibility. This project provides ways to sense visual media through touch. The Visually impaired users will be able to access eBooks, Wikipedia, etc. efficiently and quickly. The proposed work can be improved with low error and converting different languages into Braille script.
Our aim is to generate a mechanism that can
transcribe video into braille, real-time speech in Braille, text to speech, text to
braille, video to braille, and work on command with flexibility. To accomplish this,
we used the Python FFmpeg package to transcribe a video into speech and IBM
API to transcribe the speech into text, and the text derived from this speech is
converted into braille text. The system developed here will significantly help the
visually disabled to communicate and inter- act with the community in a simple
and constructive way. The day-to-day problems faced by visually impaired people
in various fields of their life has motivated us to help them in any way that could
make these daily tasks effortless.
